Op art is a form of abstract art with the use of patterns and specific colors, sometimes giving off an illusion. In my opinion Op art is unique and very intresting. I like how the patterns look, especially the ones that look like they are illusions.

I chose this website because it explains what Op art is in a very, kid-friendly way. Not like Op art is inappropriate or anything like that but it kind of dumbs the whole idea of Op Art down. It also includes lots of different examples of different Op artworks allowing viewers to get to see what Op art looks like.

I like this website because, unlike the one before, this one was more deatiled and specific. This website would be very useful if I was going to write a paper about Op art because it has a detailed explanation about teh whole Op art movement and major ideas that came from it. It also had pictures of famous Op art allowing viewers to see good examples of Op art.

This webiste goes into detail about the history of Op Art. It includes lots of different dates, helpful examples that allow you to understand Op art, and it also includes information about Op art and its ups and downs with the public. This article also includes how Op art got popular and what artists helped. This website would be very good for an Op art timeline.

Marina Apollino. (1940- Present) Born in Trieste.
I like how she used circles to create artworks that look like really cool illusions. 

Michael Kidner. (1917 - 2009) Born in Northamptonshire.
His use of bright colors and weird shapes were very intresting to me.

Nadir Afonso. (1920 - 2013) Born in Chaves, Portugal.
I think how Afonso uses bright colors and different shapes to create unique looking buildings and architecture.
