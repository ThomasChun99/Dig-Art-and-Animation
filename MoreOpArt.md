Op art is a form of abstract art with the use of patterns and specific colors, sometimes giving off an illusion. In my opinion Op art is unique and very intresting. I like how the patterns look, especially the ones that look like they are illusions.

I chose this website because it explains what Op art is in a very, kid-friendly way. Not like Op art is inappropriate but it kind of dumbs it down. It also includes lots of different examples of different Op artworks.
