Art is a way for people to express their emotions or anything really through paint, music, sculptures, and many more. Art has a major influence on many people all around the world ranging form entertainment to religious reasons. I believe art is a way for people to display their creativity however they want. 

I feel that as long as the artist says that their piece is art then you should believe that it is. This doesn't mean you have to love it but you should repect it as a piece art. The people in the video were complaining about people's scuplutes/artwork and although the pieces may not look the best the artists were asked to make it for a reason. Although you should repect the art pieces you can still critique it like some of the people in the video did. I feel that why the reason soime people don't consider some works as art is because of 1. They just don't like how it looks meaning they don't believe it counts as art or 2. They have their own opinions on art and the work that they see don't meet the requirements of their opinions. I believe art is more fluid and dynamic other than static since art not only depends on the artist but its audience as well. If you look at music for example, music has changed over periods of time. What I mean by that is that people's taste in music have changed so artists or bands change their type of mucis as well. Or you could think about it the other way too. A band/artist could write a song to a beat or theme that you've never heard of but you like it so it gains popularity making other artists copy and do te same type of music.
